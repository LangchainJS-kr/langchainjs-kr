The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

To signal his conceit, he stamps the film with the words \u201cfission\u201d (a splitting into parts) and \u201cfusion\u201d (a merging of elements); Nolan being Nolan, he further complicates the film by recurrently kinking up the overarching chronology \u2014 it is a lot.\\\\n It\u2019s also at Berkeley that Oppenheimer meets the project\u2019s military head, Leslie Groves (a predictably good Damon), who makes him Los Alamos\u2019s director, despite the leftist causes he supported \u2014 among them, the fight against fascism during the Spanish Civil War \u2014 and some of his associations, including with Communist Party members like his brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold).\\\\n\\",\\"score\\":0.91831,\\"raw_content\\":null}]",\n          "additional_kwargs": {\n            "name": "tavily_search_results_json"\n          },\n          "response_metadata": {}\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n[llm/end] [1:chain:AgentExecutor > 10:chain:ToolCallingAgent > 15:llm:ChatAnthropic] [3.50s] Exiting LLM run with output: {\n  "generations": [\n    [\n      {\n        "text": "",\n        "message": {\n          "lc": 1,\n          "type": "constructor",\n          "id": [\n            "langchain_core",\n            "messages",\n            "AIMessageChunk"\n          ],\n          "kwargs": {\n            "content": [\n              {\n                "type": "text",\n                "text": "Based on the search results, the 2023 film Oppenheimer was directed by Christopher Nolan.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\",\\"score\\":0.92404,\\"raw_content\\":null},{\\"title\\":\\"\'Oppenheimer\' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\\\\"I Try to ...\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\\",\\"content\\":\\"Oppenheimer\xa0will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and\xa0DVD \u2014 including more than three hours of bonus features \u2014 on November 21.\\\\nRELATED:\\\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear\xa0Weapons\\\\nBarbenheimer: How \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\\\nBlast From the Past: \u2018Asteroid City\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\\\nEXPLORE\xa0 HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\\\nCONNECT\xa0 FacebookTwitterInstagram\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\xa0 Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\\\nBROWSE\xa0 AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network \u201cI think with experience \u2014 and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years \u2014 you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.\u201d\\\\n \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what\u2019s going on in his own life,\u201d Thomas said.\\\\n The British-American director\u2019s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \\"Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[97] The film grossed over $836\xa0million worldwide.[98] Nominated for eight Academy Awards\u2014including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay\u2014it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[99] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[40]\\nAround the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan\'s third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \\"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism. He further wrote that Nolan\'s body of work reflect \\"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \\"a wide range of genres and settings\\" and \\"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\\".[193]\\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \\"experimental impulses\\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \\"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\\".[194] Nolan\'s use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[195][196] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \\"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \\"a largely computer-generated art form\\".[196] Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[78] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \\"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story\xa0... where you\'re looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\\".[79] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[80][81]","score":0.90288,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Christopher Nolan | Biography, Movies, Batman, Oppenheimer, & Facts ...","url":"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Nolan-British-director","content":"The sci-fi drama depicted the efforts of a group of scientists to relocate humanity from an Earth vitiated by war and famine to another planet by way of a wormhole.

It used a destabilizing reverse-order story line to mirror the fractured mental state of its protagonist, a man with short-term amnesia who is trying to track down the person who murdered his wife. The Dark Knight (2008) leaned even more heavily on the moral and structural decay of its setting, fictional Gotham City, and it revived such classic Batman villains as the Joker (played by Heath Ledger).","score":0.90219,"raw_content":null}]"\n[tool/start] [1:tool:Calculator] Entering Tool run with input: "(2023 - 1970) * 365"\n[tool/end] [1:tool:Calculator] [3ms] Exiting Tool run with output: "19345"\n{\n  input: \'Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age?

In the fall of 2014, Nolan returned to the big screen with Interstellar, a nearly three-hour sci-fi epic that follows the journey of a team of astronauts seeking a new world for the inhabitants of a besieged Earth. The director\'s career then traveled into the stratosphere, when he agreed to helm the re-launch of the comic book hero Batman with the 2005 film Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale as the titular character. Built around three storylines offering different perspectives on a dramatic turn of events in 1940, Dunkirk earned mostly rave reviews for its portrayals of the tensions and terrors of war, picking up Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture\u2014Drama and Best Director, as well as an Academy Award nod for Best Director.\\n","score":0.96408,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Christopher Nolan - Biography - IMDb","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/bio/","content":"Learn about the life and career of acclaimed writer-director Christopher Nolan, who was born on July 30, 1970, in London, England.

Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \\"Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[97] The film grossed over $836\xa0million worldwide.[98] Nominated for eight Academy Awards\u2014including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay\u2014it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[99] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[40]\\nAround the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan\'s third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \\"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism. He further wrote that Nolan\'s body of work reflect \\"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \\"a wide range of genres and settings\\" and \\"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\\".[193]\\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \\"experimental impulses\\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \\"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\\".[194] Nolan\'s use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[195][196] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \\"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \\"a largely computer-generated art form\\".[196] Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[78] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \\"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story\xa0... where you\'re looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\\".[79] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[80][81]","score":0.93205,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Christopher Nolan | Biography, Movies, Batman, Oppenheimer, & Facts ...","url":"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Nolan-British-director","content":"The sci-fi drama depicted the efforts of a group of scientists to relocate humanity from an Earth vitiated by war and famine to another planet by way of a wormhole.

Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s role in the development of the atomic bomb and the later security hearing over his alleged ties to communism. It used a destabilizing reverse-order story line to mirror the fractured mental state of its protagonist, a man with short-term amnesia who is trying to track down the person who murdered his wife. The Dark Knight (2008) leaned even more heavily on the moral and structural decay of its setting, fictional Gotham City, and it revived such classic Batman villains as the Joker (played by Heath Ledger).","score":0.90859,"raw_content":null}]"\n [tool/start] [1:tool:Calculator] Entering Tool run with input: "52 * 365"\n[tool/end] [1:tool:Calculator] [2ms] Exiting Tool run with output: "18980"\n{\n  input: \'Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age?

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\"big-atures\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\'s life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\"emotional\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\'d been involved with\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\'s perception\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.","score":0.95617,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Oppenheimer (2023) - IMDb","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/","content":"Oppenheimer: Directed by Christopher Nolan.
