## Overview

We’ll go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered
chatbot. This chatbot will be able to have a conversation and remember
previous interactions.

Note that this chatbot that we build will only use the language model to
have a conversation. There are several other related concepts that you
may be looking for:

- [Conversational RAG](../../docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history): Enable a
  chatbot experience over an external source of data
- [Agents](../../docs/tutorials/agents): Build a chatbot that can take
  actions

This tutorial will cover the basics which will be helpful for those two
more advanced topics, but feel free to skip directly to there should you
choose.

## Concepts

Here are a few of the high-level components we’ll be working with:

- [`Chat Models`](../../docs/concepts/#chat-models). The chatbot
  interface is based around messages rather than raw text, and
  therefore is best suited to Chat Models rather than text LLMs.
- [`Prompt Templates`](../../docs/concepts/#prompt-templates), which
  simplify the process of assembling prompts that combine default
  messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional
  retrieved context.
- [`Chat History`](../../docs/concepts/#chat-history), which allows a
  chatbot to “remember” past interactions and take them into account
  when responding to followup questions.
- Debugging and tracing your application using
  [LangSmith](../../docs/concepts/#langsmith)

We’ll cover how to fit the above components together to create a
powerful conversational chatbot.

## Setup

### Installation

To install LangChain run:

```mdx-code-block
import Npm2Yarn from "@theme/Npm2Yarn"

<Npm2Yarn>
  langchain
</Npm2Yarn>
```

For more details, see our [Installation
guide](../../docs/how_to/installation).

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment
variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..."
```

## Quickstart

First up, let’s learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain
supports many different language models that you can use
interchangably - select the one you want to use below!

```mdx-code-block
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs openaiParams={`model="gpt-3.5-turbo"`} />
```

Let’s first use the model directly. `ChatModel`s are instances of
LangChain “Runnables”, which means they expose a standard interface for
interacting with them. To just simply call the model, we can pass in a
list of messages to the `.invoke` method.

```typescript
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

await model.invoke([new HumanMessage({ content: "Hi! I'm Bob" })]);
```

```text
AIMessage {
  lc_serializable: true,
  lc_kwargs: {
    content: "Hello Bob, it's nice to meet you! I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. How are you doing today?",
    tool_calls: [],
    invalid_tool_calls: [],
    additional_kwargs: {
      id: "msg_015Qvu91azZviks5VzGvYT7z",
      type: "message",
      role: "assistant",
      model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
      stop_sequence: null,
      usage: { input_tokens: 12, output_tokens: 30 },
      stop_reason: "end_turn"
    },
    response_metadata: {}
  },
  lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
  content: "Hello Bob, it's nice to meet you! I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. How are you doing today?",
  name: undefined,
  additional_kwargs: {
    id: "msg_015Qvu91azZviks5VzGvYT7z",
    type: "message",
    role: "assistant",
    model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    stop_sequence: null,
    usage: { input_tokens: 12, output_tokens: 30 },
    stop_reason: "end_turn"
  },
  response_metadata: {
    id: "msg_015Qvu91azZviks5VzGvYT7z",
    model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    stop_sequence: null,
    usage: { input_tokens: 12, output_tokens: 30 },
    stop_reason: "end_turn"
  },
  tool_calls: [],
  invalid_tool_calls: []
}
```

The model on its own does not have any concept of state. For example, if
you ask a followup question:

```typescript
await model.invoke([new HumanMessage({ content: "What's my name?" })]);
```

```text
AIMessage {
  lc_serializable: true,
  lc_kwargs: {
    content: "I'm afraid I don't actually know your name. I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic.",
    tool_calls: [],
    invalid_tool_calls: [],
    additional_kwargs: {
      id: "msg_01TNDCwsU7ruVoqJwjKqNrzJ",
      type: "message",
      role: "assistant",
      model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
      stop_sequence: null,
      usage: { input_tokens: 12, output_tokens: 27 },
      stop_reason: "end_turn"
    },
    response_metadata: {}
  },
  lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
  content: "I'm afraid I don't actually know your name. I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic.",
  name: undefined,
  additional_kwargs: {
    id: "msg_01TNDCwsU7ruVoqJwjKqNrzJ",
    type: "message",
    role: "assistant",
    model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    stop_sequence: null,
    usage: { input_tokens: 12, output_tokens: 27 },
    stop_reason: "end_turn"
  },
  response_metadata: {
    id: "msg_01TNDCwsU7ruVoqJwjKqNrzJ",
    model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    stop_sequence: null,
    usage: { input_tokens: 12, output_tokens: 27 },
    stop_reason: "end_turn"
  },
  tool_calls: [],
  invalid_tool_calls: []
}
```

Let’s take a look at the example [LangSmith
trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/e5a0ae1b-32b9-4beb-836d-38f40bfa6762/r)

We can see that it doesn’t take the previous conversation turn into
context, and cannot answer the question. This makes for a terrible
chatbot experience!

To get around this, we need to pass the entire conversation history into
the model. Let’s see what happens when we do that:

```typescript
import { AIMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

await model.invoke([
  new HumanMessage({ content: "Hi! I'm Bob" }),
  new AIMessage({ content: "Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?" }),
  new HumanMessage({ content: "What's my name?" }),
]);
```

```text
AIMessage {
  lc_serializable: true,
  lc_kwargs: {
    content: "You said your name is Bob.",
    tool_calls: [],
    invalid_tool_calls: [],
    additional_kwargs: {
      id: "msg_01AEQMme3Z1MFKHW8PeDBJ7g",
      type: "message",
      role: "assistant",
      model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
      stop_sequence: null,
      usage: { input_tokens: 33, output_tokens: 10 },
      stop_reason: "end_turn"
    },
    response_metadata: {}
  },
  lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
  content: "You said your name is Bob.",
  name: undefined,
  additional_kwargs: {
    id: "msg_01AEQMme3Z1MFKHW8PeDBJ7g",
    type: "message",
    role: "assistant",
    model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    stop_sequence: null,
    usage: { input_tokens: 33, output_tokens: 10 },
    stop_reason: "end_turn"
  },
  response_metadata: {
    id: "msg_01AEQMme3Z1MFKHW8PeDBJ7g",
    model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    stop_sequence: null,
    usage: { input_tokens: 33, output_tokens: 10 },
    stop_reason: "end_turn"
  },
  tool_calls: [],
  invalid_tool_calls: []
}
```

And now we can see that we get a good response!

This is the basic idea underpinning a chatbot’s ability to interact
conversationally. So how do we best implement this?

## Message History

We can use a Message History class to wrap our model and make it
stateful. This will keep track of inputs and outputs of the model, and
store them in some datastore. Future interactions will then load those
messages and pass them into the chain as part of the input. Let’s see
how to use this!

We import the relevant classes and set up our chain which wraps the
model and adds in this message history. A key part here is the function
we pass into as the `getSessionHistory()`. This function is expected to
take in a `sessionId` and return a Message History object. This
`sessionId` is used to distinguish between separate conversations, and
should be passed in as part of the config when calling the new chain.

Let’s also create a simple chain by adding a prompt to help with
formatting:

```typescript
// We use an ephemeral, in-memory chat history for this demo.
import { InMemoryChatMessageHistory } from "@langchain/core/chat_history";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { RunnableWithMessageHistory } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const messageHistories: Record<string, InMemoryChatMessageHistory> = {};

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [
    "system",
    `You are a helpful assistant who remembers all details the user shares with you.`,
  ],
  ["placeholder", "{chat_history}"],
  ["human", "{input}"],
]);

const chain = prompt.pipe(model);

const withMessageHistory = new RunnableWithMessageHistory({
  runnable: chain,
  getMessageHistory: async (sessionId) => {
    if (messageHistories[sessionId] === undefined) {
      messageHistories[sessionId] = new InMemoryChatMessageHistory();
    }
    return messageHistories[sessionId];
  },
  inputMessagesKey: "input",
  historyMessagesKey: "chat_history",
});
```

We now need to create a `config` that we pass into the runnable every
time. This config contains information that is not part of the input
directly, but is still useful. In this case, we want to include a
`session_id`. This should look like:

```typescript
const config = {
  configurable: {
    sessionId: "abc2",
  },
};

const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
  {
    input: "Hi! I'm Bob",
  },
  config
);

response.content;
```

```text
"Hi Bob, nice to meet you! I'm an AI assistant. I'll remember that your name is Bob as we continue ou"... 110 more characters
```

```typescript
const followupResponse = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
  {
    input: "What's my name?",
  },
  config
);

followupResponse.content;
```

```text
"Your name is Bob. You introduced yourself as Bob at the start of our conversation."
```

Great! Our chatbot now remembers things about us. If we change the
config to reference a different `session_id`, we can see that it starts
the conversation fresh.

```typescript
const config = {
  configurable: {
    sessionId: "abc3",
  },
};

const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
  {
    input: "What's my name?",
  },
  config
);

response.content;
```

```text
"I'm afraid I don't actually know your name. As an AI assistant without any prior context about you, "... 61 more characters
```

However, we can always go back to the original conversation (since we
are persisting it in a database)

```typescript
const config = {
  configurable: {
    sessionId: "abc2",
  },
};

const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
  {
    input: "What's my name?",
  },
  config
);

response.content;
```

```text
`Your name is Bob. I clearly remember you telling me "Hi! I'm Bob" when we started talking.`
```

This is how we can support a chatbot having conversations with many
users!

## Managing Conversation History

One important concept to understand when building chatbots is how to
manage conversation history. If left unmanaged, the list of messages
will grow unbounded and potentially overflow the context window of the
LLM. Therefore, it is important to add a step that limits the size of
the messages you are passing in.

**Importantly, you will want to do this BEFORE the prompt template but
AFTER you load previous messages from Message History.**

We can do this by adding a simple step in front of the prompt that
modifies the `chat_history` key appropriately, and then wrap that new
chain in the Message History class. First, let’s define a function that
will modify the messages passed in. Let’s make it so that it selects the
10 most recent messages. We can then create a new chain by adding that
at the start.

```typescript
import type { BaseMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import {
  RunnablePassthrough,
  RunnableSequence,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const filterMessages = ({ chat_history }: { chat_history: BaseMessage[] }) => {
  return chat_history.slice(-10);
};

const chain = RunnableSequence.from([
  RunnablePassthrough.assign({
    chat_history: filterMessages,
  }),
  prompt,
  model,
]);
```

Let’s now try it out! If we create a list of messages more than 10
messages long, we can see what it no longer remembers information in the
early messages.

```typescript
const messages = [
  new HumanMessage({ content: "hi! I'm bob" }),
  new AIMessage({ content: "hi!" }),
  new HumanMessage({ content: "I like vanilla ice cream" }),
  new AIMessage({ content: "nice" }),
  new HumanMessage({ content: "whats 2 + 2" }),
  new AIMessage({ content: "4" }),
  new HumanMessage({ content: "thanks" }),
  new AIMessage({ content: "No problem!" }),
  new HumanMessage({ content: "having fun?" }),
  new AIMessage({ content: "yes!" }),
  new HumanMessage({ content: "That's great!" }),
  new AIMessage({ content: "yes it is!" }),
];
```

```typescript
const response = await chain.invoke({
  chat_history: messages,
  input: "what's my name?",
});
response.content;
```

```text
"I'm afraid I don't actually know your name. You haven't provided that detail to me yet."
```

But if we ask about information that is within the last ten messages, it
still remembers it

```typescript
const response = await chain.invoke({
  chat_history: messages,
  input: "what's my fav ice cream",
});
response.content;
```

```text
"You said earlier that you like vanilla ice cream."
```

Let’s now wrap this chain in a `RunnableWithMessageHistory` constructor.
For demo purposes, we will also slightly modify our
`getMessageHistory()` method to always start new sessions with the
previously declared list of 10 messages to simulate several conversation
turns:

```typescript
const messageHistories: Record<string, InMemoryChatMessageHistory> = {};

const withMessageHistory = new RunnableWithMessageHistory({
  runnable: chain,
  getMessageHistory: async (sessionId) => {
    if (messageHistories[sessionId] === undefined) {
      const messageHistory = new InMemoryChatMessageHistory();
      await messageHistory.addMessages(messages);
      messageHistories[sessionId] = messageHistory;
    }
    return messageHistories[sessionId];
  },
  inputMessagesKey: "input",
  historyMessagesKey: "chat_history",
});

const config = {
  configurable: {
    sessionId: "abc4",
  },
};

const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
  {
    input: "whats my name?",
  },
  config
);

response.content;
```

```text
"I'm afraid I don't actually know your name since you haven't provided it to me yet.  I don't have pe"... 66 more characters
```

There’s now two new messages in the chat history. This means that even
more information that used to be accessible in our conversation history
is no longer available!

```typescript
const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
  {
    input: "whats my favorite ice cream?",
  },
  config
);

response.content;
```

```text
"I'm sorry, I don't have any information about your favorite ice cream flavor since you haven't share"... 167 more characters
```

If you take a look at LangSmith, you can see exactly what is happening
under the hood in the [LangSmith
trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/ebc2e1e7-0703-43f7-a476-8cb8cbd7f61a/r).
Navigate to the chat model call to see exactly which messages are
getting filtered out.

## Streaming

Now we’ve got a functional chatbot. However, one _really_ important UX
consideration for chatbot application is streaming. LLMs can sometimes
take a while to respond, and so in order to improve the user experience
one thing that most application do is stream back each token as it is
generated. This allows the user to see progress.

It’s actually super easy to do this!

All chains expose a `.stream()` method, and ones that use message
history are no different. We can simply use that method to get back a
streaming response.

```typescript
const config = {
  configurable: {
    sessionId: "abc6",
  },
};

const stream = await withMessageHistory.stream(
  {
    input: "hi! I'm todd. tell me a joke",
  },
  config
);

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log("|", chunk.content);
}
```

```text
|
| Hi
|  Tod
| d!
|  Here
| 's
|  a
|  silly
|  joke
|  for
|  you

|  Because

```
