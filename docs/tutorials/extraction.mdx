In this tutorial, we will build a chain to extract structured
information from unstructured text.

:::important

This tutorial will only work with models that support **function/tool
calling**

:::

## Concepts

Concepts we will cover are: - Using [language
models](../../docs/concepts/#chat-models) - Using [function/tool
calling](../../docs/concepts/#function-tool-calling) - Debugging and
tracing your application using
[LangSmith](../../docs/concepts/#langsmith)

## Setup

### Installation

To install LangChain run:

```mdx-code-block
import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';

<Npm2Yarn>
  langchain
</Npm2Yarn>
```

For more details, see our [Installation
guide](../../docs/how_to/installation/).

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment
variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..."
```

## The Schema

First, we need to describe what information we want to extract from the
text.

We‚Äôll use [Zod](https://zod.dev) to define an example schema that
extracts personal information.

```mdx-code-block
<Npm2Yarn>
  zod @langchain/core
</Npm2Yarn>
```

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const personSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().nullish().describe("The name of the person"),
  hair_color: z
    .string()
    .nullish()
    .describe("The color of the person's hair if known"),
  height_in_meters: z.string().nullish().describe("Height measured in meters"),
});
```

There are two best practices when defining schema:

1.  Document the **attributes** and the **schema** itself: This
    information is sent to the LLM and is used to improve the quality of
    information extraction.
2.  Do not force the LLM to make up information! Above we used
    `.nullish()` for the attributes allowing the LLM to output `null` or
    `undefined` if it doesn‚Äôt know the answer.

:::important

For best performance, document the schema well and make sure the model
isn‚Äôt force to return results if there‚Äôs no information to be extracted
in the text.

:::

## The Extractor

Let‚Äôs create an information extractor using the schema we defined above.

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

// Define a custom prompt to provide instructions and any additional context.
// 1) You can add examples into the prompt template to improve extraction quality
// 2) Introduce additional parameters to take context into account (e.g., include metadata
//    about the document from which the text was extracted.)
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [
    "system",
    `You are an expert extraction algorithm.
Only extract relevant information from the text.
If you do not know the value of an attribute asked to extract,
return null for the attribute's value.`,
  ],
  // Please see the how-to about improving performance with
  // reference examples.
  // ["placeholder", "{examples}"],
  ["human", "{text}"],
]);
```

We need to use a model that supports function/tool calling.

Please review [the
documentation](../../docs/concepts#function-tool-calling) for list of
some models that can be used with this API.

```typescript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const llm = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
  temperature: 0,
});

const runnable = prompt.pipe(llm.withStructuredOutput(personSchema));

const text = "Alan Smith is 6 feet tall and has blond hair.";
await runnable.invoke({ text });
```

```text
{ name: "Alan Smith", hair_color: "blond", height_in_meters: "1.83" }
```

:::important

Extraction is Generative ü§Ø

LLMs are generative models, so they can do some pretty cool things like
correctly extract the height of the person in meters even though it was
provided in feet!

:::

We can see the LangSmith trace
[here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/3d44b7e8-e7ca-4e02-951d-3290ccc89d64/r).

Even though we defined our schema with the variable name `personSchema`,
Zod is unable to infer this name and therefore does not pass it along to
the model. To help give the LLM more clues as to what your provided
schema represents, you can also give the schema you pass to
`withStructuredOutput()` a name:

```typescript
const runnable = prompt.pipe(
  llm.withStructuredOutput(personSchema, { name: "person" })
);

const text = "Alan Smith is 6 feet tall and has blond hair.";

await runnable.invoke({ text });
```

```text
{ name: "Alan Smith", hair_color: "blond", height_in_meters: "1.83" }
```

This can improve performance in many cases.

## Multiple Entities

In **most cases**, you should be extracting a list of entities rather
than a single entity.

This can be easily achieved using Zod by nesting models inside one
another.

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const personSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().nullish().describe("The name of the person"),
  hair_color: z
    .string()
    .nullish()
    .describe("The color of the person's hair if known"),
  height_in_meters: z.number().nullish().describe("Height measured in meters"),
});

const dataSchema = z.object({
  people: z.array(personSchema).describe("Extracted data about people"),
});
```

:::important

Extraction might not be perfect here. Please continue to see how to use
**Reference Examples** to improve the quality of extraction, and see the
**guidelines** section!

:::

```typescript
const runnable = prompt.pipe(llm.withStructuredOutput(dataSchema));
const text =
  "My name is Jeff, my hair is black and i am 6 feet tall. Anna has the same color hair as me.";
await runnable.invoke({ text });
```

```text
{
  people: [
    { name: "Jeff", hair_color: "black", height_in_meters: 1.83 },
    { name: "Anna", hair_color: "black", height_in_meters: null }
  ]
}
```

:::tip

When the schema accommodates the extraction of **multiple entities**, it
also allows the model to extract **no entities** if no relevant
information is in the text by providing an empty list.

This is usually a **good** thing! It allows specifying **required**
attributes on an entity without necessarily forcing the model to detect
this entity.

## Next steps

Now that you understand the basics of extraction with LangChain, you‚Äôre
ready to proceed to the rest of the how-to guides:

- [Add Examples](../../docs/how_to/extraction_examples): Learn how to
  use **reference examples** to improve performance.
- [Handle Long Text](../../docs/how_to/extraction_long_text): What
  should you do if the text does not fit into the context window of
  the LLM?
- [Use a Parsing Approach](../../docs/how_to/extraction_parse): Use a
  prompt based approach to extract with models that do not support
  **tool/function calling**.
