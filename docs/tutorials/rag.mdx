One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated
question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can
answer questions about specific source information. These applications
use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG.

This tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application over a
text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A architecture
and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques.
We’ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our
application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our
application grows in complexity.

## What is RAG?

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.

LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is
limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were
trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about
private data or data introduced after a model’s cutoff date, you need to
augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it
needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting
it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG).

LangChain has a number of components designed to help build Q&A
applications, and RAG applications more generally.

**Note**: Here we focus on Q&A for unstructured data. If you are
interested for RAG over structured data, check out our tutorial on doing
[question/answering over SQL data](../../docs/tutorials/sql_qa).

## Concepts

A typical RAG application has two main components:

**Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing
it. _This usually happens offline._

**Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user
query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then
passes that to the model.

The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:

### Indexing

1.  **Load**: First we need to load our data. This is done with
    [DocumentLoaders](../../docs/concepts/#document-loaders).
2.  **Split**: [Text splitters](../../docs/concepts/#text-splitters)
    break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for
    indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks
    are harder to search over and won’t fit in a model’s finite context
    window.
3.  **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that
    they can later be searched over. This is often done using a
    [VectorStore](../../docs/concepts/#vectorstores) and
    [Embeddings](../../docs/concepts/#embedding-models) model.

### Retrieval and generation

1.  **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from
    storage using a [Retriever](../../docs/concepts/#retrievers).
2.  **Generate**: A [ChatModel](../../docs/concepts/#chat-models) /
    [LLM](../../docs/concepts/#llms) produces an answer using a prompt
    that includes the question and the retrieved data

## Setup

### Installation

To install LangChain run:

`bash npm2yarn npm i langchain`

For more details, see our [Installation
guide](../../docs/how_to/installation).

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment
variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..."
```

In this guide we’ll build a QA app over as website. The specific website
we will use isthe [LLM Powered Autonomous
Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post
by Lilian Weng, which allows us to ask questions about the contents of
the post.

We can create a simple indexing pipeline and RAG chain to do this in ~20
lines of code:

```mdx-code-block
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />
```

In this guide we’ll build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous
Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post
by Lilian Weng, which allows us to ask questions about the contents of
the post.

We can create a simple indexing pipeline and RAG chain to do this in
only a few lines of code:

```typescript
import "cheerio";
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/cheerio";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { pull } from "langchain/hub";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
```

```typescript
import { createStuffDocumentsChain } from "langchain/chains/combine_documents";

const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(
  "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"
);

const docs = await loader.load();

const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});
const splits = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(docs);
const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  splits,
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

// Retrieve and generate using the relevant snippets of the blog.
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();
const prompt = await pull<ChatPromptTemplate>("rlm/rag-prompt");
const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature: 0 });

const ragChain = await createStuffDocumentsChain({
  llm,
  prompt,
  outputParser: new StringOutputParser(),
});

const retrievedDocs = await retriever.getRelevantDocuments(
  "what is task decomposition"
);
```

Let’s see what this prompt actually looks like:

```typescript
console.log(prompt.promptMessages.map((msg) => msg.prompt.template).join("\n"));
```

```text
You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.

Answer:

```typescript
await ragChain.invoke({
  question: "What is task decomposition?",
  context: retrievedDocs,
});
```

```text

Checkout [this LangSmith
trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/54cffec3-5c26-477d-b56d-ebb66a254c8e/r)
of the chain above.

You can also construct the RAG chain above in a more declarative way
using a `RunnableSequence`. `createStuffDocumentsChain` is basically a
wrapper around `RunnableSequence`, so for more complex chains and
customizability, you can use `RunnableSequence` directly.

```typescript
import { formatDocumentsAsString } from "langchain/util/document";
import {
  RunnableSequence,
  RunnablePassthrough,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const declarativeRagChain = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    context: retriever.pipe(formatDocumentsAsString),
    question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  },
  prompt,
  llm,
  new StringOutputParser(),
]);
```

```typescript
await declarativeRagChain.invoke("What is task decomposition?");
```

```text

## Detailed walkthrough

Let’s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what’s
going on.

## 1. Indexing: Load {#indexing-load}

We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use
[DocumentLoaders](../../docs/concepts#document-loaders) for this, which
are objects that load in data from a source and return a list of
[Documents](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_documents.Document.html).
A Document is an object with some pageContent (`string`) and metadata
(`Record<string, any>`).

In this case we’ll use the
[CheerioWebBaseLoader](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_document_loaders_web_cheerio.CheerioWebBaseLoader.html),
which uses cheerio to load HTML form web URLs and parse it to text. We
can pass custom selectors to the constructor to only parse specific
elements:

```typescript
const pTagSelector = "p";
const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(
  "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",
  {
    selector: pTagSelector,
  }
);

const docs = await loader.load();
console.log(docs[0].pageContent.length);
```

```text
22054
```

```typescript
console.log(docs[0].pageContent);
```

Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like "Steps for XYZ.\n1.", "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. "Write a story outline." for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.Self-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.ReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.The ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:In both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.Reflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.The heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.Self-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.Chain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \geq r_{n-1} \geq \dots \geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\leq i \leq j \leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.To avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.The training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.The idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.The paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.In reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.In comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)Memory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.Sensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.Long-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:We can roughly consider the following mappings:The external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.A couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:Check more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.Tool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.MRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).They did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.Both TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).HuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.The system comprises of 4 stages:(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.Instruction:(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.Instruction:(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.Instruction:(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.To put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.API-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.In the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:This benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:ChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.Boiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.For example, when requested to "develop a novel anticancer drug", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:They also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.Generative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.The design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.This fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).AutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.Here is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:GPT-Engineer is another project to create a whole repository of code given a task specified in natural language. The GPT-Engineer is instructed to think over a list of smaller components to build and ask for user input to clarify questions as needed.Here are a sample conversation for task clarification sent to OpenAI ChatCompletion endpoint used by GPT-Engineer. The user inputs are wrapped in {{user input text}}.Then after these clarification, the agent moved into the code writing mode with a different system message.

package/project.Python toolbelt preferences:Conversatin samples:After going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to see a couple common limitations:Finite context length: The restricted context capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.Challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.Reliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.Cited as:Weng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). LLM-powered Autonomous Agents".

## 2. Indexing: Split {#indexing-split}

Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit
in the context window of many models. Even for those models that could
fit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find
information in very long inputs.

To handle this we’ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and
vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits
of the blog post at run time.

In this case we’ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters
with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps
mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important
context related to it. We use the
[RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](../../docs/how_to/recursive_text_splitter/),
which will recursively split the document using common separators like
new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the
recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.

```typescript
const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,

## 3. Indexing: Store {#indexing-store}

Now we need to index our 28 text chunks so that we can search over them
at runtime. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of
each document split and insert these embeddings into a vector database
(or vector store). When we want to search over our splits, we take a
text search query, embed it, and perform some sort of “similarity”
search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to
our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine
similarity — we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of
embeddings (which are high dimensional vectors).

We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command
using the [Memory](../../docs/integrations/vectorstores/memory) vector
store and
[OpenAIEmbeddings](../../docs/integrations/text_embedding/openai) model.

```typescript
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  allSplits,
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);
```

text to embeddings. - [Docs](../../docs/concepts#embedding-models):
Detailed documentation on how to use embeddings. -

to choose from. -
[Interface](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_embeddings.Embeddings.html):

`VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and
querying embeddings. - [Docs](../../docs/concepts#vectorstores):

[Integrations](../../docs/integrations/vectorstores): 40+ integrations

This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point
we have a query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our
blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return
the snippets of the blog post that answer the question.

## 4. Retrieval and Generation: Retrieve {#retrieval-and-generation-retrieve}

Now let’s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple
application that takes a user question, searches for documents relevant
to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to
a model, and returns an answer.

First we need to define our logic for searching over documents.
LangChain defines a [Retriever](../../docs/concepts#retrievers)
interface which wraps an index that can return relevant `Document`s
given a string query.

The most common type of Retriever is the
[VectorStoreRetriever](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_vectorstores.VectorStoreRetriever.html),
which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to
facilitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a
`Retriever` with `VectorStore.asRetriever()`:

```typescript
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever({ k: 6, searchType: "similarity" });
```

```typescript
const retrievedDocs = await retriever.invoke(
  "What are the approaches to task decomposition?"
);
```

```typescript
console.log(retrievedDocs.length);
```

```text
6
```

```typescript
console.log(retrievedDocs[0].pageContent);
```

```text
hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like "Steps for XYZ.\n1.", "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. "Write a story outline." for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain

### Go deeper

Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are other ways
to do retrieval, too.

`Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query -
[Docs](../../docs/concepts#retrievers): Further documentation on the
interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include: -
`MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input
question](../../docs/how_to/multiple_queries/) to improve retrieval hit
rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates
variants of the embeddings, also in order to improve retrieval hit
rate. - Max marginal relevance selects for relevance and diversity among
the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. -
Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using metadata
filters. - Integrations: Integrations with retrieval services. -
Interface: API reference for the base interface.

## 5. Retrieval and Generation: Generate {#retrieval-and-generation-generate}

Let’s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves
relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and
parses the output.

```mdx-code-block
<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />
```

We’ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub
([here](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/rlm/rag-prompt?organizationId=9213bdc8-a184-442b-901a-cd86ebf8ca6f)).

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { pull } from "langchain/hub";

const prompt = await pull<ChatPromptTemplate>("rlm/rag-prompt");
```

```typescript
const exampleMessages = await prompt.invoke({
  context: "filler context",
  question: "filler question",
});
exampleMessages;
```

```text
ChatPromptValue {
  lc_serializable: true,
  lc_kwargs: {
    messages: [
      HumanMessage {
        lc_serializable: true,
        lc_kwargs: {
          content: "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to "... 197 more characters,
          additional_kwargs: {}
        },
        lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
        content: "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to "... 197 more characters,
        name: undefined,
        additional_kwargs: {}
      }
    ]
  },
  lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "prompt_values" ],
  messages: [
    HumanMessage {
      lc_serializable: true,
      lc_kwargs: {
        content: "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to "... 197 more characters,
        additional_kwargs: {}
      },
      lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
      content: "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to "... 197 more characters,
      name: undefined,
      additional_kwargs: {}
    }
  ]
}
```

```typescript
console.log(exampleMessages.messages[0].content);
```

```text

We’ll use the [LCEL
Runnable](../../docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel)
protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components
and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in
LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box

```typescript
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import {
  RunnablePassthrough,
  RunnableSequence,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { formatDocumentsAsString } from "langchain/util/document";

const ragChain = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    context: retriever.pipe(formatDocumentsAsString),
    question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  },
  prompt,
  llm,
  new StringOutputParser(),
]);
```

```typescript
for await (const chunk of await ragChain.stream(
  "What is task decomposition?"
)) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

```text

from the prompt hub. The prompt can also be easily customized:

```typescript
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { createStuffDocumentsChain } from "langchain/chains/combine_documents";

const template = `Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer as concise as possible.
Always say "thanks for asking!" at the end of the answer.

{context}

Question: {question}

Helpful Answer:`;

const customRagPrompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(template);

const ragChain = await createStuffDocumentsChain({
  llm,
  prompt: customRagPrompt,
  outputParser: new StringOutputParser(),
});
const context = await retriever.getRelevantDocuments(
  "what is task decomposition"
);

await ragChain.invoke({
  question: "What is Task Decomposition?",
  context,
});
