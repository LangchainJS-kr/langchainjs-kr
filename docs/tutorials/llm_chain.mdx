In this quickstart we’ll show you how to build a simple LLM application
with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into
another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it’s
just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way
to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just
some prompting and an LLM call!

After reading this tutorial, you’ll have a high level overview of:

- Using [language models](../../docs/concepts/#chat-models)

- Using [PromptTemplates](../../docs/concepts/#prompt-templates) and
  [OutputParsers](../../docs/concepts/#output-parsers)

- Using [LangChain Expression Language
  (LCEL)](../../docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language) to chain
  components together

- Debugging and tracing your application using
  [LangSmith](../../docs/concepts/#langsmith)

Let’s dive in!

## Setup

### Installation

To install LangChain run:

```mdx-code-block
import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Npm2Yarn>
  langchain
</Npm2Yarn>
```

For more details, see our [Installation
guide](../../docs/how_to/installation/).

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment
variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..."
```

## Using Language Models

First up, let’s learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain
supports many different language models that you can use
interchangably - select the one you want to use below!

```mdx-code-block
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs openaiParams={`model: "gpt-4"`} />
```

Let’s first use the model directly. `ChatModel`s are instances of
LangChain “Runnables”, which means they expose a standard interface for
interacting with them. To just simply call the model, we can pass in a
list of messages to the `.invoke` method.

```typescript
import { HumanMessage, SystemMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const messages = [
  new SystemMessage("Translate the following from English into Italian"),
  new HumanMessage("hi!"),
];

await model.invoke(messages);
```

```text
AIMessage {
  lc_serializable: true,
  lc_kwargs: {
    content: "ciao!",
    tool_calls: [],
    invalid_tool_calls: [],
    additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined },
    response_metadata: {}
  },
  lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
  content: "ciao!",
  name: undefined,
  additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined },
  response_metadata: {
    tokenUsage: { completionTokens: 3, promptTokens: 20, totalTokens: 23 },
    finish_reason: "stop"
  },
  tool_calls: [],
  invalid_tool_calls: []
}
```

If we’ve enable LangSmith, we can see that this run is logged to
LangSmith, and can see the [LangSmith
trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/45f1a650-38fb-41e1-9b61-becc0684f2ce/r)

## OutputParsers

Notice that the response from the model is an `AIMessage`. This contains
a string response along with other metadata about the response.
Oftentimes we may just want to work with the string response. We can
parse out just this response by using a simple output parser.

We first import the simple output parser.

```typescript
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";

const parser = new StringOutputParser();
```

One way to use it is to use it by itself. For example, we could save the
result of the language model call and then pass it to the parser.

```typescript
const result = await model.invoke(messages);
```

```typescript
await parser.invoke(result);
```

```text
"ciao!"
```

## Chaining together components with LCEL

We can also “chain” the model to the output parser. This means this
output parser will get called with the output from the model. This chain
takes on the input type of the language model (string or list of
message) and returns the output type of the output parser (string).

We can create the chain using the `.pipe()` method. The `.pipe()` method
is used in LangChain to combine two elements together.

```typescript
const chain = model.pipe(parser);
```

```typescript
await chain.invoke(messages);
```

```text
"Ciao!"
```

This is a simple example of using [LangChain Expression Language
(LCEL)](../../docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language) to chain
together LangChain modules. There are several benefits to this approach,
including optimized streaming and tracing support.

If we now look at LangSmith, we can see that the chain has two steps:
first the language model is called, then the result of that is passed to
the output parser. We can see the [LangSmith
trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/05bec1c1-fc51-4b2c-ab3b-4b63709e4462/r)

## Prompt Templates

Right now we are passing a list of messages directly into the language
model. Where does this list of messages come from? Usually it
constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This
application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it
into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common
transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template
with the user input.

PromptTemplates are a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this
transformation. They take in raw user input and return data (a prompt)
that is ready to pass into a language model.

Let’s create a PromptTemplate here. It will take in two user variables:

- `language`: The language to translate text into
- `text`: The text to translate

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
```

First, let’s create a string that we will format to be the system
message:

```typescript
const systemTemplate = "Translate the following into {language}:";
```

Next, we can create the PromptTemplate. This will be a combination of
the `systemTemplate` as well as a simpler template for where to put the
text

```typescript
const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", systemTemplate],
  ["user", "{text}"],
]);
```

The input to this prompt template is a dictionary. We can play around
with this prompt template by itself to see what it does by itself

```typescript
const result = await promptTemplate.invoke({ language: "italian", text: "hi" });

result;
```

```text
ChatPromptValue {
  lc_serializable: true,
  lc_kwargs: {
    messages: [
      SystemMessage {
        lc_serializable: true,
        lc_kwargs: {
          content: "Translate the following into italian:",
          additional_kwargs: {},
          response_metadata: {}
        },
        lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
        content: "Translate the following into italian:",
        name: undefined,
        additional_kwargs: {},
        response_metadata: {}
      },
      HumanMessage {
        lc_serializable: true,
        lc_kwargs: { content: "hi", additional_kwargs: {}, response_metadata: {} },
        lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
        content: "hi",
        name: undefined,
        additional_kwargs: {},
        response_metadata: {}
      }
    ]
  },
  lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "prompt_values" ],
  messages: [
    SystemMessage {
      lc_serializable: true,
      lc_kwargs: {
        content: "Translate the following into italian:",
        additional_kwargs: {},
        response_metadata: {}
      },
      lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
      content: "Translate the following into italian:",
      name: undefined,
      additional_kwargs: {},
      response_metadata: {}
    },
    HumanMessage {
      lc_serializable: true,
      lc_kwargs: { content: "hi", additional_kwargs: {}, response_metadata: {} },
      lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
      content: "hi",
      name: undefined,
      additional_kwargs: {},
      response_metadata: {}
    }
  ]
}
```

We can see that it returns a `ChatPromptValue` that consists of two
messages. If we want to access the messages directly we do:

```typescript
result.toChatMessages();
```

```text
[
  SystemMessage {
    lc_serializable: true,
    lc_kwargs: {
      content: "Translate the following into italian:",
      additional_kwargs: {},
      response_metadata: {}
    },
    lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
    content: "Translate the following into italian:",
    name: undefined,
    additional_kwargs: {},
    response_metadata: {}
  },
  HumanMessage {
    lc_serializable: true,
    lc_kwargs: { content: "hi", additional_kwargs: {}, response_metadata: {} },
    lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
    content: "hi",
    name: undefined,
    additional_kwargs: {},
    response_metadata: {}
  }
]
```

We can now combine this with the model and the output parser from above.
This will chain all three components together.

```typescript
const chain = promptTemplate.pipe(model).pipe(parser);
```

```typescript
await chain.invoke({ language: "italian", text: "hi" });
```

```text
"ciao"
```

If we take a look at the LangSmith trace, we can see all three
components show up in the [LangSmith
trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/cef6edcd-39ed-4c1e-86f7-491a1b611aeb/r)
