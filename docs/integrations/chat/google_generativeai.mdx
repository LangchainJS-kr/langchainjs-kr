# ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

You can access Google's `gemini` and `gemini-vision` models, as well as other
generative models in LangChain through `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` class in the
`@langchain/google-genai` integration package.

:::tip
You can also access Google's `gemini` family of models via the LangChain VertexAI and VertexAI-web integrations.

You'll first need to install the `@langchain/google-genai` package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/google-genai
```

## Usage

import UnifiedModelParamsTooltip from "@mdx_components/unified_model_params_tooltip.mdx";

<UnifiedModelParamsTooltip></UnifiedModelParamsTooltip>

import GoogleGenerativeAI from "@examples/models/chat/googlegenerativeai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{GoogleGenerativeAI}</CodeBlock>

## Multimodal support

To provide an image, pass a human message with a `content` field set to an array of content objects. Each content object
where each dict contains either an image value (type of image_url) or a text (type of text) value. The value of image_url must be a base64
encoded image (e.g., data:image/png;base64,abcd124):

import GoogleGenerativeAIMultimodal from "@examples/models/chat/googlegenerativeai_multimodal.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{GoogleGenerativeAIMultimodal}</CodeBlock>

## Gemini Prompting FAQs

As of the time this doc was written (2023/12/12), Gemini has some restrictions on the types and structure of prompts it accepts. Specifically:

1. When providing multimodal (image) inputs, you are restricted to at most 1 message of "human" (user) type. You cannot pass multiple messages (though the single human message may have multiple content entries)
2. System messages are not natively supported, and will be merged with the first human message if present.
3. For regular chat conversations, messages must follow the human/ai/human/ai alternating pattern. You may not provide 2 AI or human messages in sequence.
4. Message may be blocked if they violate the safety checks of the LLM. In this case, the model will return an empty response.
