# Azure OpenAI

[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service/) is a cloud service to help you quickly develop generative AI experiences with a diverse set of prebuilt and curated models from OpenAI, Meta and beyond.

LangChain.js supports integration with [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service/) using the new Azure integration in the [OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node).

You can learn more about Azure OpenAI and its difference with the OpenAI API on [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview). If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.

:::info

Previously, LangChain.js supported integration with Azure OpenAI using the dedicated [Azure OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai). This SDK is now deprecated in favor of the new Azure integration in the OpenAI SDK, which allows to access the latest OpenAI models and features the same day they are released, and allows seemless transition between the OpenAI API and Azure OpenAI.

If you are using Azure OpenAI with the deprecated SDK, see the [migration guide](#migration-from-azure-openai-sdk) to update to the new API.

:::

## Setup

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/openai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/openai) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @langchain/openai
```

You'll also need to have an Azure OpenAI instance deployed. You can deploy a version on Azure Portal following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).

Once you have your instance running, make sure you have the name of your instance and key. You can find the key in the Azure Portal, under the "Keys and Endpoint" section of your instance.

If you're using Node.js, you can define the following environment variables to use the service:

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME=<YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-02-01"
```

Alternatively, you can pass the values directly to the `AzureOpenAI` constructor:

import AzureOpenAI from "@examples/models/llm/azure_openai.ts";

import UnifiedModelParamsTooltip from "@mdx_components/unified_model_params_tooltip.mdx";

<UnifiedModelParamsTooltip></UnifiedModelParamsTooltip>

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AzureOpenAI}</CodeBlock>

You can find the list of supported API versions in the [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/reference).

### Using Azure Managed Identity

If you're using Azure Managed Identity, you can configure the credentials like this:

import AzureOpenAIManagedIdentity from "@examples/models/llm/azure_openai-managed_identity.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AzureOpenAIManagedIdentity}</CodeBlock>

### Using a different domain

If your instance is hosted under a domain other than the default `openai.azure.com`, you'll need to use the alternate `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_PATH` environment variable.
For example, here's how you would connect to the domain `https://westeurope.api.microsoft.com/openai/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}`:

import AzureOpenAIBasePath from "@examples/models/llm/azure_openai-base_path.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AzureOpenAIBasePath}</CodeBlock>

### LLM usage example

import LLMExample from "@examples/llms/azure_openai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{LLMExample}</CodeBlock>

### Chat usage example

import ChatExample from "@examples/llms/azure_openai-chat.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ChatExample}</CodeBlock>

## Migration from Azure OpenAI SDK

If you are using the deprecated Azure OpenAI SDK with the `@langchain/azure-openai` package, you can update your code to use the new Azure integration following these steps:

1. Install the new `@langchain/openai` package and remove the previous `@langchain/azure-openai` package:
   ```bash npm2yarn
   npm install @langchain/openai
   npm uninstall @langchain/azure-openai
   ```
2. Update your imports to use the new `AzureOpenAI` and `AzureChatOpenAI` classes from the `@langchain/openai` package:
   ```typescript
   import { AzureOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
   ```
3. Update your code to use the new `AzureOpenAI` and `AzureChatOpenAI` classes and pass the required parameters:

   ```typescript
   const model = new AzureOpenAI({
     azureOpenAIApiKey: "<your_key>",
     azureOpenAIApiInstanceName: "<your_instance_name>",
     azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "<your_deployment_name>",
     azureOpenAIApiVersion: "<api_version>",
   });
   ```

   Notice that the constructor now requires the `azureOpenAIApiInstanceName` parameter instead of the `azureOpenAIEndpoint` parameter, and adds the `azureOpenAIApiVersion` parameter to specify the API version.

   - If you were using Azure Managed Identity, you now need to use the `azureADTokenProvider` parameter to the constructor instead of `credentials`, see the [Azure Managed Identity](#using-azure-managed-identity) section for more details.

   - If you were using environment variables, you now have to set the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME` environment variable instead of `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT`, and add the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` environment variable to specify the API version.
