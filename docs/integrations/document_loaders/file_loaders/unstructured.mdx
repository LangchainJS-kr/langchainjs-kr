# Unstructured

This example covers how to use Unstructured to load files of many types. Unstructured currently supports loading of text files, powerpoints, html, pdfs, images, and more.

## Setup

You can run Unstructured locally in your computer using Docker. To do so, you need to have Docker installed. You can find the instructions to install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -d --rm --name unstructured-api quay.io/unstructured-io/unstructured-api:latest --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Usage

Once Unstructured is running, you can use it to load files from your computer. You can use the following code to load a file from your computer.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/unstructured.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Directories

You can also load all of the files in the directory using [`UnstructuredDirectoryLoader`](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_document_loaders_fs_unstructured.UnstructuredDirectoryLoader.html), which inherits from [`DirectoryLoader`](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/file_loaders/directory):

import DirectoryExample from "@examples/document_loaders/unstructured_directory.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DirectoryExample}</CodeBlock>
