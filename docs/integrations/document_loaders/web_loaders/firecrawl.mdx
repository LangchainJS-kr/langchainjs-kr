# Firecrawl

This guide shows how to use [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) with LangChain to load web data into an LLM-ready format using Firecrawl.

## Overview

[FireCrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) crawls and convert any website into LLM-ready data. It crawls all accessible subpages and give you clean markdown and metadata for each. No sitemap required.

FireCrawl handles complex tasks such as reverse proxies, caching, rate limits, and content blocked by JavaScript. Built by the [mendable.ai](https://mendable.ai) team.

This guide shows how to scrap and crawl entire websites and load them using the `FireCrawlLoader` in LangChain.

## Setup

Sign up and get your free [FireCrawl API key](https://firecrawl.dev) to start. FireCrawl offers 300 free credits to get you started, and it's [open-source](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl) in case you want to self-host.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `FireCrawlLoader` to load web search results:

Firecrawl offers 2 modes: `scrape` and `crawl`. In `scrape` mode, Firecrawl will only scrape the page you provide. In `crawl` mode, Firecrawl will crawl the entire website.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
