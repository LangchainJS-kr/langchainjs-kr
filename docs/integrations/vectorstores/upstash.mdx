# Upstash Vector

Upstash Vector is a REST based serverless vector database, designed for working with vector embeddings.

## Setup

1. Create Upstash Vector Index

You can create an index from [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/vector). For further reference, see [docs](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/getstarted).

2. Install Upstash Vector SDK.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @upstash/vector
```

We use OpenAI for the embeddings of the below examples.
However, you can also create the embeddings using the model of your choice, that is available in the LangChain.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community
```

## Create Upstash Vector Client

There are two ways to create the client. You can either pass the credentials as string manually from the `.env` file (or as string variables), or you can retrieve the credentials from the environment automatically.

## Index and Query Documents

You can index the LangChain documents with any model of your choice, and perform a search over these documents. It's possible to apply metadata filtering to the search results. See [the related docs here](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/filtering).
