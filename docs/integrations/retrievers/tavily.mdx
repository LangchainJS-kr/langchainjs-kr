# Tavily Search API

[Tavily's Search API](https://tavily.com) is a search engine built specifically for AI agents (LLMs), delivering real-time, accurate, and factual results at speed.

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community
```

You will need to populate a `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable with your Tavily API key or pass it into the constructor as `apiKey`.

For a full list of allowed arguments, see [the official documentation](https://app.tavily.com/documentation/api). You can also pass any param to the SDK via a `kwargs` object.
