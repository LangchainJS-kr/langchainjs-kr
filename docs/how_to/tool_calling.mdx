title: How to use a chat model to call tools
---

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat models](../../docs/concepts/#chat-models)
- [LangChain Tools](../../docs/concepts/#tools)

:::

```mdx-code-block
:::info
We use the term tool calling interchangeably with function calling. Although
function calling is sometimes meant to refer to invocations of a single function,
we treat all models as though they can return multiple tool or function calls in
each message.
:::
```

Tool calling allows a chat model to respond to a given prompt by
‚Äúcalling a tool‚Äù. While the name implies that the model is performing
some action, this is actually not the case! The model generates the
arguments to a tool, and actually running the tool (or not) is up to the
user. For example, if you want to [extract output matching some
schema](../../docs/how_to/structured_output/) from unstructured text,
you could give the model an ‚Äúextraction‚Äù tool that takes parameters
matching the desired schema, then treat the generated output as your
final result.

However, tool calling goes beyond [structured
output](../../docs/how_to/structured_output/) since you can pass
responses to caled tools back to the model to create longer
interactions. For instance, given a search engine tool, an LLM might
handle a query by first issuing a call to the search engine with
arguments. The system calling the LLM can receive the tool call, execute
it, and return the output to the LLM to inform its response. LangChain
includes a suite of [built-in tools](../../docs/integrations/tools/) and
supports several methods for defining your own [custom
tools](../../docs/how_to/custom_tools).

Tool calling is not universal, but many popular LLM providers, including
[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/),
[Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai),
[Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), and
others, support variants of a tool calling feature.

LangChain implements standard interfaces for defining tools, passing
them to LLMs, and representing tool calls. This guide will show you how
to use them.

## Passing tools to LLMs

Chat models that support tool calling features implement a
[`.bindTools()`](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html#bindTools)
method, which receives a list of LangChain [tool
objects](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_tools.StructuredTool.html)
and binds them to the chat model in its expected format. Subsequent
invocations of the chat model will include tool schemas in its calls to
the LLM.

Let‚Äôs walk through a few examples:

```mdx-code-block
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" providers={["anthropic", "openai", "mistral", "fireworks"]} additionalDependencies="@langchain/core" />
```

A number of models implement helper methods that will take care of
formatting and binding different function-like objects to the model.
Let‚Äôs take a look at how we might take the following Zod function schema
and get different models to invoke it:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

/**
 * Note that the descriptions here are crucial, as they will be passed along
 * to the model along with the class name.
 */
const calculatorSchema = z.object({
  operation: z
    .enum(["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"])
    .describe("The type of operation to execute."),
  number1: z.number().describe("The first number to operate on."),
  number2: z.number().describe("The second number to operate on."),
});
```

We can use the `.bindTools()` method to handle the conversion from
LangChain tool to our model provider‚Äôs specific format and bind it to
the model (i.e., passing it in each time the model is invoked). Let‚Äôs
create a `DynamicStructuredTool` implementing a tool based on the above
schema, then bind it to the model:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { DynamicStructuredTool } from "@langchain/core/tools";

const calculatorTool = new DynamicStructuredTool({
  name: "calculator",
  description: "Can perform mathematical operations.",
  schema: calculatorSchema,
  func: async ({ operation, number1, number2 }) => {
    // Functions must return strings
    if (operation === "add") {
      return `${number1 + number2}`;
    } else if (operation === "subtract") {
      return `${number1 - number2}`;
    } else if (operation === "multiply") {
      return `${number1 * number2}`;
    } else if (operation === "divide") {
      return `${number1 / number2}`;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Invalid operation.");
    }
  },
});

const llmWithTools = llm.bindTools([calculatorTool]);
```

Now, let‚Äôs invoke it! We expect the model to use the calculator to
answer the question:

```typescript
const res = await llmWithTools.invoke("What is 3 * 12");

console.log(res.tool_calls);
```

```text
[
  {
    name: "calculator",
    args: { operation: "multiply", number1: 3, number2: 12 },
    id: "call_Ri9s27J17B224FEHrFGkLdxH"
  }
]
```

```mdx-code-block
:::tip
See a LangSmith trace for the above [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/14e4b50c-c6cf-4c53-b3ef-da550edb6d66/r).
:::
```

We can see that the response message contains a `tool_calls` field when
the model decides to call the tool. This will be in LangChain‚Äôs
standardized format.

The `.tool_calls` attribute should contain valid tool calls. Note that
on occasion, model providers may output malformed tool calls (e.g.,
arguments that are not valid JSON). When parsing fails in these cases,
the message will contain instances of of
[InvalidToolCall](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/types/langchain_core_messages_tool.InvalidToolCall.html)
objects in the `.invalid_tool_calls` attribute. An `InvalidToolCall` can
have a name, string arguments, identifier, and error message.

### Streaming

When tools are called in a streaming context, [message
chunks](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_messages.BaseMessageChunk.html)
will be populated with [tool call
chunk](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/types/langchain_core_messages_tool.ToolCallChunk.html)
objects in a list via the `.tool_call_chunks` attribute. A
`ToolCallChunk` includes optional string fields for the tool `name`,
`args`, and `id`, and includes an optional integer field `index` that
can be used to join chunks together. Fields are optional because
portions of a tool call may be streamed across different chunks (e.g., a
chunk that includes a substring of the arguments may have null values
for the tool name and id).

Because message chunks inherit from their parent message class, an
[AIMessageChunk](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_messages.AIMessageChunk.html)
with tool call chunks will also include `.tool_calls` and
`.invalid_tool_calls` fields. These fields are parsed best-effort from
the message‚Äôs tool call chunks.

Note that not all providers currently support streaming for tool calls.
If this is the case for your specific provider, the model will yield a
single chunk with the entire call when you call `.stream()`.

```typescript
const stream = await llmWithTools.stream("What is 308 / 29");

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk.tool_call_chunks);
}
```

```text
[
  {
    name: "calculator",
    args: "",
    id: "call_rGqPR1ivppYUeBb0iSAF8HGP",
    index: 0
  }
]
[ { name: undefined, args: '{"', id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "operation", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: '":"', id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "divide", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: '","', id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "number", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "1", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: '":', id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "308", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: ',"', id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "number", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "2", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: '":', id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "29", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[ { name: undefined, args: "}", id: undefined, index: 0 } ]
[]
```

Note that using the `concat` method on message chunks will merge their
corresponding tool call chunks. This is the principle by which
LangChain‚Äôs various [tool output
parsers](../../docs/how_to/output_parser_structured/) support streaming.

For example, below we accumulate tool call chunks:

```typescript
const streamWithAccumulation = await llmWithTools.stream(
  "What is 32993 - 2339"
);

let final;
for await (const chunk of streamWithAccumulation) {
  if (!final) {
    final = chunk;
  } else {
    final = final.concat(chunk);
  }
}

console.log(final.tool_calls);
```

```text
[
  {
    name: "calculator",
    args: { operation: "subtract", number1: 32993, number2: 2339 },
    id: "call_WMhL5X0fMBBZPNeyUZY53Xuw"
  }
]
```

## Few shotting with tools

You can give the model examples of how you would like tools to be called
in order to guide generation by inputting manufactured tool call turns.
For example, given the above calculator tool, we could define a new
operator, `ü¶ú`. Let‚Äôs see what happens when we use it naively:

```typescript
const res = await llmWithTools.invoke("What is 3 ü¶ú 12");

console.log(res.content);
console.log(res.tool_calls);
```

```text
It seems like you've used an emoji (ü¶ú) in your expression, which I'm not familiar with in a mathematical context. Could you clarify what operation you meant by using the parrot emoji? For example, did you mean addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division?
[]
```

It doesn‚Äôt quite know how to interpret `ü¶ú` as an operation. Now, let‚Äôs
try giving it an example in the form of a manufactured messages to steer
it towards `divide`:

```typescript
import { HumanMessage, AIMessage, ToolMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const res = await llmWithTools.invoke([
  new HumanMessage("What is 333382 ü¶ú 1932?"),
  new AIMessage({
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [
      {
        id: "12345",
        name: "calulator",
        args: {
          number1: 333382,
          number2: 1932,
          operation: "divide",
        },
      },
    ],
  }),
  new ToolMessage({
    tool_call_id: "12345",
    content: "The answer is 172.558.",
  }),
  new AIMessage("The answer is 172.558."),
  new HumanMessage("What is 3 ü¶ú 12"),
]);
console.log(res.tool_calls);
```

```text
[
  {
    name: "calculator",
    args: { operation: "divide", number1: 3, number2: 12 },
    id: "call_BDuJv8QkDZ7N7Wsd6v5VDeVa"
  }
]
```

## Binding model-specific formats (advanced)

Providers adopt different conventions for formatting tool schemas. For
instance, OpenAI uses a format like this:

- `type`: The type of the tool. At the time of writing, this is always
  ‚Äúfunction‚Äù.
- `function`: An object containing tool parameters.
- `function.name`: The name of the schema to output.
- `function.description`: A high level description of the schema to
  output.
- `function.parameters`: The nested details of the schema you want to
  extract, formatted as a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)
  object.

We can bind this model-specific format directly to the model if needed.
Here‚Äôs an example:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" });

const modelWithTools = model.bind({
  tools: [
    {
      type: "function",
      function: {
        name: "calculator",
        description: "Can perform mathematical operations.",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            operation: {
              type: "string",
              description: "The type of operation to execute.",
              enum: ["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"],
            },
            number1: { type: "number", description: "First integer" },
            number2: { type: "number", description: "Second integer" },
          },
          required: ["number1", "number2"],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});

await modelWithTools.invoke(`Whats 119 times 8?`);
```

```text
AIMessage {
  lc_serializable: true,
  lc_kwargs: {
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [
      {
        name: "calculator",
        args: { operation: "multiply", number1: 119, number2: 8 },
        id: "call_pBlKOPNMRN4AAMkPaOKLLcyj"
      }
    ],
    invalid_tool_calls: [],
    additional_kwargs: {
      function_call: undefined,
      tool_calls: [
        {
          id: "call_pBlKOPNMRN4AAMkPaOKLLcyj",
          type: "function",
          function: [Object]
        }
      ]
    },
    response_metadata: {}
  },
  lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
  content: "",
  name: undefined,
  additional_kwargs: {
    function_call: undefined,
    tool_calls: [
      {
        id: "call_pBlKOPNMRN4AAMkPaOKLLcyj",
        type: "function",
        function: {
          name: "calculator",
          arguments: '{"operation":"multiply","number1":119,"number2":8}'
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  response_metadata: {
    tokenUsage: { completionTokens: 24, promptTokens: 85, totalTokens: 109 },
    finish_reason: "tool_calls"
  },
  tool_calls: [
    {
      name: "calculator",
      args: { operation: "multiply", number1: 119, number2: 8 },
      id: "call_pBlKOPNMRN4AAMkPaOKLLcyj"
    }
  ],
  invalid_tool_calls: []
}
```

This is functionally equivalent to the `bind_tools()` calls above.
