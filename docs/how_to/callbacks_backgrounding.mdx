title: How to make callbacks run in the background
---

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Callbacks](../../docs/concepts/#callbacks)

:::

By default, LangChain.js callbacks are blocking. This means that
execution will wait for the callback to either return or timeout before
continuing. This is to help ensure that if you are running code in
[serverless
environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) such
as [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/) or [Cloudflare
Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), these callbacks always finish
before the execution context ends.

However, this can add unnecessary latency if you are running in
traditional stateful environments. If desired, you can set your
callbacks to run in the background to avoid this additional latency by
setting the `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` environment variable to
`"true"`. You can then import the global
[`awaitAllCallbacks`](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain_core_callbacks_promises.awaitAllCallbacks.html)
method to ensure all callbacks finish if necessary.

To illustrate this, we’ll create a [custom callback
handler](../../docs/how_to/custom_callbacks) that takes some time to
resolve, and show the timing with and without
`LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` set. Here it is without the variable
set:

```typescript
import { RunnableLambda } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

Deno.env.set("LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND", "false");

const runnable = RunnableLambda.from(() => "hello!");

const customHandler = {
  handleChainEnd: async () => {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    console.log("Call finished");
  },
};

const startTime = new Date().getTime();

await runnable.invoke({ number: "2" }, { callbacks: [customHandler] });

console.log(`Elapsed time: ${new Date().getTime() - startTime}ms`);
```

```text
Call finished
Elapsed time: 2005ms
```

And here it is with backgrounding on:

```typescript
import { awaitAllCallbacks } from "@langchain/core/callbacks/promises";

Deno.env.set("LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND", "true");

const startTime = new Date().getTime();

await runnable.invoke({ number: "2" }, { callbacks: [customHandler] });

console.log(`Initial elapsed time: ${new Date().getTime() - startTime}ms`);

await awaitAllCallbacks();

console.log(`Final elapsed time: ${new Date().getTime() - startTime}ms`);
```

```text
Initial elapsed time: 0ms
Call finished
Final elapsed time: 2098ms
```

## Next steps

You’ve now learned how to run callbacks in the background to reduce
latency.

Next, check out the other how-to guides in this section, such as [how to
create custom callback handlers](../../docs/how_to/custom_callbacks).
