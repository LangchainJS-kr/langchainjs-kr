title: How to handle multiple queries
---

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

- [Query analysis](../../docs/tutorials/query_analysis)

:::

Sometimes, a query analysis technique may allow for multiple queries to
be generated. In these cases, we need to remember to run all queries and
then to combine the results. We will show a simple example (using mock
data) of how to do that.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```mdx-code-block
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";
import Npm2Yarn from "@theme/Npm2Yarn";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

<Npm2Yarn>
  @langchain/community @langchain/openai zod chromadb
</Npm2Yarn>
```

### Set environment variables

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Optional, use LangSmith for best-in-class observability
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-api-key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
```

### Create Index

We will create a vectorstore over fake information.

```typescript
import { Chroma } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/chroma";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import "chromadb";

const texts = ["Harrison worked at Kensho", "Ankush worked at Facebook"];
const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({ model: "text-embedding-3-small" });
const vectorstore = await Chroma.fromTexts(texts, {}, embeddings, {
  collectionName: "multi_query",
});
const retriever = vectorstore.asRetriever(1);
```

## Query analysis

We will use function calling to structure the output. We will let it
return multiple queries.

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const searchSchema = z
  .object({
    queries: z.array(z.string()).describe("Distinct queries to search for"),
  })
  .describe("Search over a database of job records.");
```

```mdx-code-block
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />
```

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import {
  RunnableSequence,
  RunnablePassthrough,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const system = `You have the ability to issue search queries to get information to help answer user information.

If you need to look up two distinct pieces of information, you are allowed to do that!`;

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", system],
  ["human", "{question}"],
]);
const llmWithTools = llm.withStructuredOutput(searchSchema, {
  name: "Search",
});
const queryAnalyzer = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  },
  prompt,
  llmWithTools,
]);
```

We can see that this allows for creating multiple queries

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer.invoke("where did Harrison Work");
```

```text
{ queries: [ "Harrison" ] }
```

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer.invoke("where did Harrison and ankush Work");
```

```text
{ queries: [ "Harrison work", "Ankush work" ] }
```

## Retrieval with query analysis

So how would we include this in a chain? One thing that will make this a
lot easier is if we call our retriever asyncronously - this will let us
loop over the queries and not get blocked on the response time.

```typescript
import { RunnableConfig, RunnableLambda } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const chain = async (question: string, config?: RunnableConfig) => {
  const response = await queryAnalyzer.invoke(question, config);
  const docs = [];
  for (const query of response.queries) {
    const newDocs = await retriever.invoke(query, config);
    docs.push(...newDocs);
  }
  // You probably want to think about reranking or deduplicating documents here
  // But that is a separate topic
  return docs;
};

const customChain = new RunnableLambda({ func: chain });
```

```typescript
await customChain.invoke("where did Harrison Work");
```

```text
[ Document { pageContent: "Harrison worked at Kensho", metadata: {} } ]
```

```typescript
await customChain.invoke("where did Harrison and ankush Work");
```

```text
[
  Document { pageContent: "Harrison worked at Kensho", metadata: {} },
  Document { pageContent: "Ankush worked at Facebook", metadata: {} }
]
```

## Next steps

Youâ€™ve now learned some techniques for handling multiple queries in a
query analysis system.

generated](../../docs/how_to/query_no_queries).
