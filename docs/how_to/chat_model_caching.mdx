# How to cache chat model responses

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models)
- [LLMs](/docs/concepts/#llms)

:::

LangChain provides an optional caching layer for chat models. This is useful for two reasons:

It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you're often requesting the same completion multiple times.
It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// To make the caching really obvious, lets use a slower model.
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4",
  cache: true,
});
```

## In Memory Cache

The default cache is stored in-memory. This means that if you restart your application, the cache will be cleared.

```typescript
console.time();

// The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer
const res = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke!");
console.log(res);

console.timeEnd();

/*
  AIMessage {
    lc_serializable: true,
    lc_kwargs: {
      content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
      additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
    },
    lc_namespace: [ 'langchain_core', 'messages' ],
    content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
    name: undefined,
    additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
  }
  default: 2.224s
*/
```

```typescript
console.time();

// The second time it is, so it goes faster
const res2 = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke!");
console.log(res2);

console.timeEnd();
/*
  AIMessage {
    lc_serializable: true,
    lc_kwargs: {
      content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
      additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
    },
    lc_namespace: [ 'langchain_core', 'messages' ],
    content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
    name: undefined,
    additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
  }
  default: 181.98ms
*/
```

## Caching with Redis

LangChain also provides a Redis-based cache. This is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers.
To use it, you'll need to install the `redis` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install ioredis @langchain/community
```

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import RedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/redis.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching on the File System

:::warning
This cache is not recommended for production use. It is only intended for local development.
:::

LangChain provides a simple file system cache.
By default the cache is stored a temporary directory, but you can specify a custom directory if you want.

```typescript
const cache = await LocalFileCache.create();
```
