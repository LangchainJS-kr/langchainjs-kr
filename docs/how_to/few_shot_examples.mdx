title: How to use few shot examples
---

In this guide, we’ll learn how to create a simple prompt template that
provides the model with example inputs and outputs when generating.
Providing the LLM with a few such examples is called few-shotting, and
is a simple yet powerful way to guide generation and in some cases
drastically improve model performance.

A few-shot prompt template can be constructed from either a set of
examples, or from an [Example
Selector](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_example_selectors.BaseExampleSelector.html)
class responsible for choosing a subset of examples from the defined
set.

This guide will cover few-shotting with string prompt templates. For a
guide on few-shotting with chat messages for chat models, see
[here](../../docs/how_to/few_shot_examples_chat/).

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Prompt templates](../../docs/concepts/#prompt-templates)
- [Example selectors](../../docs/concepts/#example-selectors)
- [LLMs](../../docs/concepts/#llms)
- [Vectorstores](../../docs/concepts/#vectorstores)

:::

## Create a formatter for the few-shot examples

Configure a formatter that will format the few-shot examples into a
string. This formatter should be a `PromptTemplate` object.

```typescript
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const examplePrompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(
  "Question: {question}\n{answer}"
);
```

## Creating the example set

Next, we’ll create a list of few-shot examples. Each example should be a
dictionary representing an example input to the formatter prompt we
defined above.

```typescript
const examples = [
  {
    question: "Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?",
    answer: `
  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
  Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
  Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
  Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
  So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
  `,
  },
  {
    question: "When was the founder of craigslist born?",
    answer: `
  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
  Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
  Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
  Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
  So the final answer is: December 6, 1952
  `,
  },
  {
    question: "Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?",
    answer: `
  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
  Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
  Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
  Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
  So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
  `,
  },
  {
    question:
      "Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?",
    answer: `
  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
  Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
  Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
  Intermediate Answer: The United States.
  Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
  Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
  Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
  Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
  So the final answer is: No
  `,
  },
];
```

### Pass the examples and formatter to `FewShotPromptTemplate`

Finally, create a
[`FewShotPromptTemplate`](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_prompts.FewShotPromptTemplate.html)
object. This object takes in the few-shot examples and the formatter for
the few-shot examples. When this `FewShotPromptTemplate` is formatted,
it formats the passed examples using the `examplePrompt`, then and adds
them to the final prompt before `suffix`:

```typescript
import { FewShotPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const prompt = new FewShotPromptTemplate({
  examples,
  examplePrompt,
  suffix: "Question: {input}",
  inputVariables: ["input"],
});

const formatted = await prompt.format({
  input: "Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?",
});
console.log(formatted.toString());
```

```text


Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?

  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
  Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
  Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
  Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
  So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali


Question: When was the founder of craigslist born?

  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
  Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
  Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
  Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
  So the final answer is: December 6, 1952


Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?

  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
  Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
  Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
  Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
  So the final answer is: Joseph Ball


Question: Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?

  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
  Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
  Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
  Intermediate Answer: The United States.
  Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
  Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
  Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
  Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
  So the final answer is: No


Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
```

By providing the model with examples like this, we can guide the model
to a better response.

## Using an example selector

We will reuse the example set and the formatter from the previous
section. However, instead of feeding the examples directly into the
`FewShotPromptTemplate` object, we will feed them into an implementation
of `ExampleSelector` called
[`SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector`](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_example_selectors.SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.html)
instance. This class selects few-shot examples from the initial set
based on their similarity to the input. It uses an embedding model to
compute the similarity between the input and the few-shot examples, as
well as a vector store to perform the nearest neighbor search.

To show what it looks like, let’s initialize an instance and call it in
isolation:

Set your OpenAI API key for the embeddings model

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

```typescript
import { SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector } from "@langchain/core/example_selectors";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const exampleSelector = await SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.fromExamples(
  // This is the list of examples available to select from.
  examples,
  // This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.
  new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
  // This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.
  MemoryVectorStore,
  {
    // This is the number of examples to produce.
    k: 1,
  }
);

// Select the most similar example to the input.
const question = "Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?";
const selectedExamples = await exampleSelector.selectExamples({ question });
console.log(`Examples most similar to the input: ${question}`);
for (const example of selectedExamples) {
  console.log("\n");
  console.log(
    Object.entries(example)
      .map(([k, v]) => `${k}: ${v}`)
      .join("\n")
  );
}
```

```text
Examples most similar to the input: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?


question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?
answer:
  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
  Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
  Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
  Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
  So the final answer is: Joseph Ball

```

Now, let’s create a `FewShotPromptTemplate` object. This object takes in
the example selector and the formatter prompt for the few-shot examples.

```typescript
const prompt = new FewShotPromptTemplate({
  exampleSelector,
  examplePrompt,
  suffix: "Question: {input}",
  inputVariables: ["input"],
});

const formatted = await prompt.invoke({
  input: "Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?",
});
console.log(formatted.toString());
```

```text


Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?

  Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
  Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
  Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
  Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
  Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
  So the final answer is: Joseph Ball


Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
```
