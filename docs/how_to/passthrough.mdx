title: How to pass through arguments from one step to the next

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [LangChain Expression Language
  (LCEL)](../../docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language)
- [Chaining runnables](../../docs/how_to/sequence/)
- [Calling runnables in parallel](../../docs/how_to/parallel/)
- [Custom functions](../../docs/how_to/functions/)

:::

When composing chains with several steps, sometimes you will want to
pass data from previous steps unchanged for use as input to a later
step. The
[`RunnablePassthrough`](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_runnables.RunnablePassthrough.html)
class allows you to do just this, and is typically is used in conjuction
with a [RunnableParallel](../../docs/how_to/parallel/) to pass data
through to a later step in your constructed chains.

Let’s look at an example:

```typescript
import {
  RunnableParallel,
  RunnablePassthrough,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const runnable = RunnableParallel.from({
  passed: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  modified: (input) => input.num + 1,
});

await runnable.invoke({ num: 1 });
```

```text
{ passed: { num: 1 }, modified: 2 }
```

As seen above, `passed` key was called with `RunnablePassthrough()` and
so it simply passed on `{'num': 1}`.

We also set a second key in the map with `modified`. This uses a lambda
to set a single value adding 1 to the num, which resulted in `modified`
key with the value of `2`.

## Retrieval Example

In the example below, we see a more real-world use case where we use
`RunnablePassthrough` along with `RunnableParallel` in a chain to
properly format inputs to a prompt:

```mdx-code-block
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";
import Npm2Yarn from "@theme/Npm2Yarn";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

<Npm2Yarn>
  @langchain/openai
</Npm2Yarn>
```

```typescript
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import {
  RunnablePassthrough,
  RunnableSequence,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";

const vectorstore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  [{ pageContent: "harrison worked at kensho", metadata: {} }],
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

const retriever = vectorstore.asRetriever();

const template = `Answer the question based only on the following context:
{context}

Question: {question}
`;

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(template);

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" });

const retrievalChain = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    context: retriever.pipe((docs) => docs[0].pageContent),
    question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  },
  prompt,
  model,
  new StringOutputParser(),
]);

await retrievalChain.invoke("where did harrison work?");
```

```text
"Harrison worked at Kensho."
```

Here the input to prompt is expected to be a map with keys `"context"`
and `"question"`. The user input is just the question. So we need to get
the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the
`"question"` key. The `RunnablePassthrough` allows us to pass on the
user’s question to the prompt and model.

## Next steps

Now you’ve learned how to pass data through your chains to help to help
format the data flowing through your chains.
