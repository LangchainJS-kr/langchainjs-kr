title: How to split code
---

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Text splitters](../../docs/concepts#text-splitters)
- [Recursively splitting text by
  character](../../docs/how_to/recursive_text_splitter)

:::

[RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_textsplitters.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.html)
includes pre-built lists of separators that are useful for splitting
text in a specific programming language.

Supported languages include:

```text
"html" | "cpp" | "go" | "java" | "js" | "php" | "proto" | "python" | "rst" | "ruby" | "rust" | "scala" | "swift" | "markdown" | "latex" | "sol"
```

To view the list of separators for a given language, pass one of the
values from the list above into the `getSeparatorsForLanguage()` static
method

```typescript
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";

RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.getSeparatorsForLanguage("js");
```

```text
[
  "\nfunction ", "\nconst ",
  "\nlet ",      "\nvar ",
  "\nclass ",    "\nif ",
  "\nfor ",      "\nwhile ",
  "\nswitch ",   "\ncase ",
  "\ndefault ",  "\n\n",
  "\n",          " ",
  ""
]
```

## JS

Here‚Äôs an example using the JS text splitter:

```typescript
const JS_CODE = `
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

// Call the function
helloWorld();
`;

const jsSplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("js", {
  chunkSize: 60,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const jsDocs = await jsSplitter.createDocuments([JS_CODE]);

jsDocs;
```

```text
[
  Document {
    pageContent: 'function helloWorld() {\n  console.log("Hello, World!");\n}',
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 2, to: 4 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "// Call the function\nhelloWorld();",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 6, to: 7 } } }
  }
]
```

## Python

Here‚Äôs an example for Python:

```typescript
const PYTHON_CODE = `
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Call the function
hello_world()
`;

const pythonSplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("python", {
  chunkSize: 50,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const pythonDocs = await pythonSplitter.createDocuments([PYTHON_CODE]);
pythonDocs;
```

```text
[
  Document {
    pageContent: 'def hello_world():\n    print("Hello, World!")',
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 2, to: 3 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "# Call the function\nhello_world()",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 5, to: 6 } } }
  }
]
```

## Markdown

Here‚Äôs an example of splitting on markdown separators:

```typescript
const markdownText = `
# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain

‚ö° Building applications with LLMs through composability ‚ö°

## Quick Install

\`\`\`bash
# Hopefully this code block isn't split
pip install langchain
\`\`\`

As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions.
`;

const mdSplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("markdown", {
  chunkSize: 60,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const mdDocs = await mdSplitter.createDocuments([markdownText]);

mdDocs;
```

````text
[
  Document {
    pageContent: "# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 2, to: 2 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "‚ö° Building applications with LLMs through composability ‚ö°",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 4, to: 4 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "## Quick Install",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 6, to: 6 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "```bash\n# Hopefully this code block isn't split",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 8, to: 9 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "pip install langchain",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 10, to: 10 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "```",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 11, to: 11 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 13, to: 13 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "are extremely open to contributions.",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 13, to: 13 } } }
  }
]
````

## Latex

Here‚Äôs an example on Latex text:

```typescript
const latexText = `
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Large language models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning model that can be trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language. In recent years, LLMs have made significant advances in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis.

\subsection{History of LLMs}
The earliest LLMs were developed in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were limited by the amount of data that could be processed and the computational power available at the time. In the past decade, however, advances in hardware and software have made it possible to train LLMs on massive datasets, leading to significant improvements in performance.

\subsection{Applications of LLMs}
LLMs have many applications in industry, including chatbots, content creation, and virtual assistants. They can also be used in academia for research in linguistics, psychology, and computational linguistics.

\end{document}
`;

const latexSplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("latex", {
  chunkSize: 60,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const latexDocs = await latexSplitter.createDocuments([latexText]);

latexDocs;
```

## HTML

Here‚Äôs an example using an HTML text splitter:

```typescript
const htmlText = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain</title>
        <style>
            body {
                font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            }
            h1 {
                color: darkblue;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <h1>ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain</h1>
            <p>‚ö° Building applications with LLMs through composability ‚ö°</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions.
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
`;

const htmlSplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("html", {
  chunkSize: 60,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const htmlDocs = await htmlSplitter.createDocuments([htmlText]);
htmlDocs;
```

```text
[
  Document {
    pageContent: "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 2, to: 3 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "<head>\n        <title>ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain</title>",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 4, to: 5 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "<style>\n            body {\n                font-family:",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 6, to: 8 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "Arial, sans-serif;\n            }\n            h1 {",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 8, to: 10 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "color: darkblue;\n            }\n        </style>",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 11, to: 13 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "</head>",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 14, to: 14 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "<body>",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 15, to: 15 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "<div>\n            <h1>ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain</h1>",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 16, to: 17 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "<p>‚ö° Building applications with LLMs through composability",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 18, to: 18 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "‚ö°</p>\n        </div>",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 18, to: 19 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "<div>\n            As an open-source project in a rapidly",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 20, to: 21 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "developing field, we are extremely open to contributions.",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 21, to: 21 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "</div>\n    </body>\n</html>",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 22, to: 24 } } }
  }
]
```

## Solidity

Here‚Äôs an example using of splitting on
[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) code:

```typescript
const SOL_CODE = `
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
contract HelloWorld {
   function add(uint a, uint b) pure public returns(uint) {
       return a + b;
   }
}
`;

const solSplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("sol", {
  chunkSize: 128,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const solDocs = await solSplitter.createDocuments([SOL_CODE]);
solDocs;
```

```text
[
  Document {
    pageContent: "pragma solidity ^0.8.20;",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 2, to: 2 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "contract HelloWorld {\n" +
      "   function add(uint a, uint b) pure public returns(uint) {\n" +
      "       return a + "... 9 more characters,
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 3, to: 7 } } }
  }
]
```

## PHP

Here‚Äôs an example of splitting on PHP code:

```typescript
const PHP_CODE = `<?php
namespace foo;
class Hello {
    public function __construct() { }
}
function hello() {
    echo "Hello World!";
}
interface Human {
    public function breath();
}
trait Foo { }
enum Color
{
    case Red;
    case Blue;
}`;

const phpSplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("php", {
  chunkSize: 50,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const phpDocs = await phpSplitter.createDocuments([PHP_CODE]);

phpDocs;
```

```text
[
  Document {
    pageContent: "<?php\nnamespace foo;",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 1, to: 2 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "class Hello {",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 3, to: 3 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "public function __construct() { }\n}",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 4, to: 5 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: 'function hello() {\n    echo "Hello World!";\n}',
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 6, to: 8 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "interface Human {\n    public function breath();\n}",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 9, to: 11 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "trait Foo { }\nenum Color\n{\n    case Red;",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 12, to: 15 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "case Blue;\n}",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 16, to: 17 } } }
  }
]
```
