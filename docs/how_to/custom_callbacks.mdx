title: How to create custom callback handlers
---

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Callbacks](../../docs/concepts/#callbacks)

:::

LangChain has some built-in callback handlers, but you will often want
to create your own handlers with custom logic.

To create a custom callback handler, we need to determine the
[event(s)](https://api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/langchain_core_callbacks_base.CallbackHandlerMethods.html)
we want our callback handler to handle as well as what we want our
callback handler to do when the event is triggered. Then all we need to
do is attach the callback handler to the object, for example via [the
constructor](../../docs/how_to/callbacks_constructor) or [at
runtime](../../docs/how_to/callbacks_runtime).

An easy way to construct a custom callback handler is to initialize it
as an object whose keys are functions with names matching the events we
want to handle. Here’s an example that only handles the start of a chat
model and streamed tokens from the model run:

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`What is 1 + {number}?`);
const model = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
});

const chain = prompt.pipe(model);

const customHandler = {
  handleChatModelStart: async (llm, inputMessages, runId) => {
    console.log("Chat model start:", llm, inputMessages, runId);
  },
  handleLLMNewToken: async (token) => {
    console.log("Chat model new token", token);
  },
};

const stream = await chain.stream(
  { number: "2" },
  { callbacks: [customHandler] }
);

for await (const _ of stream) {
  // Just consume the stream so the callbacks run
}
```

```text

  lc: 1,
  type: "constructor",
  id: [ "langchain", "chat_models", "anthropic", "ChatAnthropic" ],

        response_metadata: {}
      },
      lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
      content: "What is 1 + 2?",
      name: undefined,
      additional_kwargs: {},
      response_metadata: {}
    }
  ]

You can see [this reference
page](https://api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/langchain_core_callbacks_base.CallbackHandlerMethods.html)
for a list of events you can handle. Note that the `handleChain*` events
run for most LCEL runnables.

## Next steps

You’ve now learned how to create your own custom callback handlers.

Next, check out the other how-to guides in this section, such as [how to
background callbacks](../../docs/how_to/callbacks_backgrounding).
