title: How to return sources
---

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

- [Retrieval-augmented generation](../../docs/tutorials/rag/)

:::

Often in Q&A applications it’s important to show users the sources that
were used to generate the answer. The simplest way to do this is for the
chain to return the Documents that were retrieved in each generation.

We’ll be using the [LLM Powered Autonomous
Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post
by Lilian Weng for retrieval content this notebook.

## Setup

### Dependencies

We’ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Memory vector store
in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any
[ChatModel](../../docs/concepts/#chat-models) or
[LLM](../../docs/concepts#llms),
[Embeddings](../../docs/concepts#embedding-models), and
[VectorStore](../../docs/concepts#vectorstores) or
[Retriever](../../docs/concepts#retrievers).

We’ll use the following packages:

```bash
npm install --save langchain @langchain/openai cheerio
```

We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to
use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set
your environment variables to start logging traces:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

## Chain without sources

Here is the Q&A app we built over the [LLM Powered Autonomous
Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post
by Lilian Weng in the
[Quickstart](../../docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/).

```typescript
import "cheerio";
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/cheerio";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { pull } from "langchain/hub";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { formatDocumentsAsString } from "langchain/util/document";
import {
  RunnableSequence,
  RunnablePassthrough,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";

const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(
  "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"
);

const docs = await loader.load();

const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});
const splits = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(docs);
const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  splits,
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

// Retrieve and generate using the relevant snippets of the blog.
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();
const prompt = await pull<ChatPromptTemplate>("rlm/rag-prompt");
const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature: 0 });

const ragChain = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    context: retriever.pipe(formatDocumentsAsString),
    question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  },
  prompt,
  llm,
  new StringOutputParser(),
]);
```

Let’s see what this prompt actually looks like:

```typescript
console.log(prompt.promptMessages.map((msg) => msg.prompt.template).join("\n"));
```

```text
You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.
Question: {question}
Context: {context}
Answer:
```

```typescript
await ragChain.invoke("What is task decomposition?");
```

```text
"Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. I"... 208 more characters
```

## Adding sources

With LCEL, we can easily pass the retrieved documents through the chain
and return them in the final response:

```typescript
import {
  RunnableMap,
  RunnablePassthrough,
  RunnableSequence,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { formatDocumentsAsString } from "langchain/util/document";

const ragChainFromDocs = RunnableSequence.from([
  RunnablePassthrough.assign({
    context: (input) => formatDocumentsAsString(input.context),
  }),
  prompt,
  llm,
  new StringOutputParser(),
]);

let ragChainWithSource = new RunnableMap({
  steps: { context: retriever, question: new RunnablePassthrough() },
});
ragChainWithSource = ragChainWithSource.assign({ answer: ragChainFromDocs });

await ragChainWithSource.invoke("What is Task Decomposition");
```

```text
{
  question: "What is Task Decomposition",
  context: [

    }
