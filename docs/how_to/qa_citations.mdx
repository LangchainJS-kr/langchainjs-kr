title: How to return citations
---

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

- [Retrieval-augmented generation](../../docs/tutorials/rag/)
- [Returning structured data from a
  model](../../docs/how_to/structured_output/)

:::

How can we get a model to cite which parts of the source documents it
referenced in its response?

To explore some techniques for extracting citations, let’s first create
a simple RAG chain. To start we’ll just retrieve from the web using the
[`TavilySearchAPIRetriever`](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/tavily).

## Setup

### Dependencies

We’ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Memory vector store
in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any
[ChatModel](../../docs/concepts/#chat-models) or
[LLM](../../docs/concepts#llms),
[Embeddings](../../docs/concepts#embedding-models/), and
[VectorStore](../../docs/concepts#vectorstores/) or
[Retriever](../../docs/concepts#retrievers).

We’ll use the following packages:

```bash
npm install --save langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai
```

We need to set environment variables for Tavily Search & OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
export TAVILY_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to
use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set
your environment variables to start logging traces:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### Initial setup

```typescript
import { TavilySearchAPIRetriever } from "@langchain/community/retrievers/tavily_search_api";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature: 0,
});

const retriever = new TavilySearchAPIRetriever({
  k: 6,
});

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [
    "system",
    "You're a helpful AI assistant. Given a user question and some web article snippets, answer the user question. If none of the articles answer the question, just say you don't know.\n\nHere are the web articles:{context}",
  ],
  ["human", "{question}"],
]);
```

Now that we’ve got a model, retriever and prompt, let’s chain them all
together. We’ll need to add some logic for formatting our retrieved
`Document`s to a string that can be passed to our prompt. We’ll make it
so our chain returns both the answer and the retrieved Documents.

```typescript
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { RunnableMap, RunnablePassthrough } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

/**
 * Format the documents into a readable string.
 */
const formatDocs = (input: Record<string, any>): string => {
  const { docs } = input;
  return (
    "\n\n" +
    docs
      .map(
        (doc: Document) =>
          `Article title: ${doc.metadata.title}\nArticle Snippet: ${doc.pageContent}`
      )
      .join("\n\n")
  );
};
// subchain for generating an answer once we've done retrieval
const answerChain = prompt.pipe(llm).pipe(new StringOutputParser());
const map = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,
});
// complete chain that calls the retriever -> formats docs to string -> runs answer subchain -> returns just the answer and retrieved docs.
const chain = map
  .assign({ context: formatDocs })
  .assign({ answer: answerChain })
  .pick(["answer", "docs"]);

await chain.invoke("How fast are cheetahs?");
```

## Tool calling

### Cite documents

Let’s try using [tool calling](../../docs/how_to/tool_calling) to make
the model specify which of the provided documents it’s actually
referencing when answering. LangChain has some utils for converting
objects or [Zod](https://zod.dev) objects to the JSONSchema format
expected by providers like OpenAI. We’ll use the
[`.withStructuredOutput()`](../../docs/how_to/structured_output/) method
to get the model to output data matching our desired schema:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const llmWithTool1 = llm.withStructuredOutput(
  z
    .object({
      answer: z
        .string()
        .describe(
          "The answer to the user question, which is based only on the given sources."
        ),
      citations: z
        .array(z.number())
        .describe(
          "The integer IDs of the SPECIFIC sources which justify the answer."
        ),
    })
    .describe("A cited source from the given text"),
  {
    name: "cited_answers",
  }
);

const exampleQ = `What is Brian's height?

Source: 1
Information: Suzy is 6'2"

Source: 2
Information: Jeremiah is blonde

Source: 3
Information: Brian is 3 inches shorter than Suzy`;

await llmWithTool1.invoke(exampleQ);
```

```text
{
  answer: `Brian is 6'2" - 3 inches = 5'11" tall.`,
  citations: [ 1, 3 ]
}
```

that shows off the internals

Now we’re ready to put together our chain

```typescript
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const formatDocsWithId = (docs: Array<Document>): string => {
  return (
    "\n\n" +
    docs
      .map(
        (doc: Document, idx: number) =>
          `Source ID: ${idx}\nArticle title: ${doc.metadata.title}\nArticle Snippet: ${doc.pageContent}`
      )
      .join("\n\n")
  );
};
// subchain for generating an answer once we've done retrieval
const answerChain1 = prompt.pipe(llmWithTool1);
const map1 = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,
});
// complete chain that calls the retriever -> formats docs to string -> runs answer subchain -> returns just the answer and retrieved docs.
const chain1 = map1
  .assign({
    context: (input: { docs: Array<Document> }) => formatDocsWithId(input.docs),
  })
  .assign({ cited_answer: answerChain1 })
  .pick(["cited_answer", "docs"]);

await chain1.invoke("How fast are cheetahs?");

that shows off the internals.

### Cite snippets

What if we want to cite actual text spans? We can try to get our model
to return these, too.

**Note**: Note that if we break up our documents so that we have many
documents with only a sentence or two instead of a few long documents,
citing documents becomes roughly equivalent to citing snippets, and may
be easier for the model because the model just needs to return an
identifier for each snippet instead of the actual text. We recommend
trying both approaches and evaluating.

```typescript
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const citationSchema = z.object({
  sourceId: z
    .number()
    .describe(
      "The integer ID of a SPECIFIC source which justifies the answer."
    ),
  quote: z
    .string()
    .describe(
      "The VERBATIM quote from the specified source that justifies the answer."
    ),
});

const llmWithTool2 = llm.withStructuredOutput(
  z.object({
    answer: z
      .string()
      .describe(
        "The answer to the user question, which is based only on the given sources."
      ),
    citations: z
      .array(citationSchema)
      .describe("Citations from the given sources that justify the answer."),
  }),
  {
    name: "quoted_answer",
  }
);

const answerChain2 = prompt.pipe(llmWithTool2);
const map2 = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,
});
// complete chain that calls the retriever -> formats docs to string -> runs answer subchain -> returns just the answer and retrieved docs.
const chain2 = map2
  .assign({
    context: (input: { docs: Array<Document> }) => formatDocsWithId(input.docs),
  })
  .assign({ quoted_answer: answerChain2 })
  .pick(["quoted_answer", "docs"]);

await chain2.invoke("How fast are cheetahs?");
```

## Direct prompting

Not all models support tool-calling. We can achieve similar results with
direct prompting. Let’s see what this looks like using an older
Anthropic chat model that is particularly proficient in working with
XML:

### Setup

Install the LangChain Anthropic integration package:

```bash
npm install @langchain/anthropic
```

Add your Anthropic API key to your environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

```typescript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { XMLOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";
import {
  RunnableLambda,
  RunnablePassthrough,
  RunnableMap,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const anthropic = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-instant-1.2",
  temperature: 0,
});
const system = `You're a helpful AI assistant. Given a user question and some web article snippets,
answer the user question and provide citations. If none of the articles answer the question, just say you don't know.

Remember, you must return both an answer and citations. A citation consists of a VERBATIM quote that
justifies the answer and the ID of the quote article. Return a citation for every quote across all articles
that justify the answer. Use the following format for your final output:

<cited_answer>
    <answer></answer>
    <citations>
        <citation><source_id></source_id><quote></quote></citation>
        <citation><source_id></source_id><quote></quote></citation>
        ...
    </citations>
</cited_answer>

Here are the web articles:{context}`;

const anthropicPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", system],
  ["human", "{question}"],
]);

const formatDocsToXML = (docs: Array<Document>): string => {
  const formatted: Array<string> = [];
  docs.forEach((doc, idx) => {
    const docStr = `<source id="${idx}">
  <title>${doc.metadata.title}</title>
  <article_snippet>${doc.pageContent}</article_snippet>
</source>`;
    formatted.push(docStr);
  });
  return `\n\n<sources>${formatted.join("\n")}</sources>`;
};

const format3 = new RunnableLambda({
  func: (input: { docs: Array<Document> }) => formatDocsToXML(input.docs),
});
const answerChain = anthropicPrompt
  .pipe(anthropic)
  .pipe(new XMLOutputParser())
  .pipe(
    new RunnableLambda({
      func: (input: { cited_answer: any }) => input.cited_answer,
    })
  );
const map3 = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,
});
const chain3 = map3
  .assign({ context: format3 })
  .assign({ cited_answer: answerChain })
  .pick(["cited_answer", "docs"]);

const res = await chain3.invoke("How fast are cheetahs?");

console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
```

## Retrieval post-processing

Another approach is to post-process our retrieved documents to compress
the content, so that the source content is already minimal enough that
we don’t need the model to cite specific sources or spans. For example,
we could break up each document into a sentence or two, embed those and
keep only the most relevant ones. LangChain has some built-in components
for this. Here we’ll use a
[`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter),
which creates chunks of a specified size by splitting on separator
substrings, and an
[`EmbeddingsFilter`](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/contextual_compression#embeddingsfilter),
which keeps only the texts with the most relevant embeddings.

```typescript
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { EmbeddingsFilter } from "langchain/retrievers/document_compressors/embeddings_filter";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { DocumentInterface } from "@langchain/core/documents";
import { RunnableMap, RunnablePassthrough } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 400,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
  separators: ["\n\n", "\n", ".", " "],
  keepSeparator: false,
});

const compressor = new EmbeddingsFilter({
  embeddings: new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
  k: 10,
});

const splitAndFilter = async (input): Promise<Array<DocumentInterface>> => {
  const { docs, question } = input;
  const splitDocs = await splitter.splitDocuments(docs);
  const statefulDocs = await compressor.compressDocuments(splitDocs, question);
  return statefulDocs;
};

const retrieveMap = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,

const retriever = retrieveMap.pipe(splitAndFilter);

The science of cheetah speed
The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is the fastest land animal on Earth, capable of reaching speeds as high as 75 mph or 120 km/h. Cheetahs are predators that sneak up on their prey and sprint a short distance to chase and attack.
 Key Takeaways: How Fast Can a Cheetah Run?
Fastest Cheetah on Earth


Built for speed, the cheetah can accelerate from zero to 45 in just 2.5 seconds and reach top speeds of 60 to 70 mph, making it the fastest land mammal! Fun Facts

NZCBI staff in Front Royal, Virginia, are mourning the loss of Walnut, a white-naped crane who became an internet sensation for choosing one of her keepers as her mate.


The speeds attained by the cheetah may be only slightly greater than those achieved by the pronghorn at 88.5 km/h (55.0 mph)[96] and the springbok at 88 km/h (55 mph),[97] but the cheetah additionally has an exceptional acceleration.[98]


The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal.[88][89][90][91][92] Estimates of the maximum speed attained range from 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph).[60][63] A commonly quoted value is 112 km/h (70 mph), recorded in 1957, but this measurement is disputed.[93] The mouth can not be opened as widely as in other cats given the shorter length of muscles between the jaw and the skull


Scientists calculate a cheetah's top speed is 75 mph, but the fastest recorded speed is somewhat slower. The top 10 fastest animals are:


One stride of a galloping cheetah measures 4 to 7 m (13 to 23 ft); the stride length and the number of jumps increases with speed.[60] During more than half the duration of the sprint, the cheetah has all four limbs in the air, increasing the stride length.[99] Running cheetahs can retain up to 90% of the heat generated during the chase


The pronghorn, an American animal resembling an antelope, is the fastest land animal in the Western Hemisphere. While a cheetah's top speed ranges from 65 to 75 mph (104 to 120 km/h), its average speed is only 40 mph (64 km/hr), punctuated by short bursts at its top speed. Basically, if a predator threatens to take a cheetah's kill or attack its young, a cheetah has to run.


A cheetah eats a variety of small animals, including game birds, rabbits, small antelopes (including the springbok, impala, and gazelle), young warthogs, and larger antelopes (such as the kudu, hartebeest, oryx, and roan). Their faces are distinguished by prominent black lines that curve from the inner corner of each eye to the outer corners of the mouth, like a well-worn trail of inky tears.


Cheetahs are one of the most iconic pursuit predators, hunting primarily throughout the day, sometimes with peaks at dawn and dusk; they tend to avoid larger predators like the primarily nocturnal lion.[66] Cheetahs in the Sahara and Maasai Mara in Kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day
