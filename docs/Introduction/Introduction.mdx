# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

- **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel) and [components](/docs/how_to/). Hit the ground running using [third-party integrations](/docs/integrations/platforms/).
- **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn any chain into an API with [LangServe](https://www.langchain.com/langserve).

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

- **`@langchain/core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`@langchain/community`**: Third party integrations.
  - Partner packages (e.g. **`@langchain/openai`**, **`@langchain/anthropic`**, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on **`@langchain/core`**.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- **[langgraph](https://www.langchain.com/langserveh)**: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.
- **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.
